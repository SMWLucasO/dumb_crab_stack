# IP-addressing
To know TCP/IP, we must know about the Internet Protocol (IP). It is vital to destructure the entire concept of an
IP address, both IPv4 and IPv6, which are quite different in how they work. Even if the intended result is the same.

For example, IPv4 is structured as `127.0.0.1`, whereas an IPv6 address may look something like `::1`. That is definitely
a different structure, and these differences are not just for semantic and/or aesthetical purposes.
